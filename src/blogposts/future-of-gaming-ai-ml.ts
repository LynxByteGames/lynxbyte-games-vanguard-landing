      <h2>How AI is Changing Game Design</h2>
      <p>AI-driven systems allow for dynamic storytelling, adaptive difficulty, and emergent gameplay. Games like <strong>No Man's Sky</strong> use procedural algorithms to generate entire universes, while titles such as <strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> employ advanced AI for realistic enemy behaviors and emotional storytelling.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Procedural Content Generation:</strong> AI can create vast, unique worlds, reducing manual workload and increasing replayability.</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligent NPCs:</strong> Modern AI enables NPCs to learn, adapt, and interact with players in more lifelike ways.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Experiences:</strong> Machine learning can tailor game content and difficulty to individual player styles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Machine Learning in Game Development</h2>
      <p>ML models are being used to analyze player data, predict trends, and even generate new game assets. For example, AI can help balance multiplayer games by analyzing win/loss ratios and suggesting adjustments in real time.</p>
      <h3>Examples of ML in Games</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AI-powered voice acting and dialogue generation</li>
        <li>Automated bug detection and quality assurance</li>
        <li>Player behavior prediction for matchmaking and content recommendations</li>
      </ul>
